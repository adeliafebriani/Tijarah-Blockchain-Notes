### Public Blockchains
1. Definition: A decentralized network that anyone can join and participate in. Open, making data **fully accessible** to the public.
2. Characteristics:
   * Transparency
   * Immutability
   * Transaction are visible to all
   * Once recorded, the data cannot be altered
   * Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS) to validate transactions
3. Example:
   * Bitcoin
   * Ethereum
   * MaalChain
4. Use Cases: Ideal for applications that require transparency and security like cryptocurrencies

### Private Blockchains
1. Definition: Permission networks where the access is **controlled by an organization or a consortium of organizations**. They are not open to the public.
2. Characteristics:
   * Privacy is a priority
   * Transaction are visible to authorized participants
   * The rules of the network are set by the controlling organization(s)
   * Use more efficient consensus mechanisms since the number of participating nodes is smaller and more trusted.
4. Examples:
   * Hyperledger Fabric
   * Corda
5. Use Cases: Suitable for business and enterprise solutions where privacy and speed are important, such as supply chain management or internal voting systems.

### Consortium Blockchains
1. Definition: A hybrid model, **operated by a group of organizations rather than a single entity, partially decentralized**.
2. Characteristics:
   * Multiple organizations manage the blockchain.
   * This approach allows for a higher level of governance, efficiency, and security compared to public blockchains.
   * The consensus process is controlled by pre-selected nodes.
4. Examples:
   * Energy Web Foundation
   * Quorum
6. Use Cases: Ideal for industries where multiple entities need to collaborate securely without fully trusting each other, such as in the banking sector or healthcare records.

### Differentiate Public, Private & Consortium

### Conclusion 
* Each type of blockchain serves different needs
* Public: maximum transparency where trust among participants is low.
* Private: efficiency and privacy, suitable for corporate environments.
* Consortium: both, balanced approach among multiple organizations. Depends on the specific requirements of privacy, trust, scalability, and control.
