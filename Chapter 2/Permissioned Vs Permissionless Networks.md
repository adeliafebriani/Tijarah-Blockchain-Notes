### Permissionless Networks
1. Definition: Open and decentralized. ***Anyone can join and participate*** in the network without  permission. These networks epitomize the original ethos of blockchain technology, emphasizing decentralization and inclusivity.
2. Characteristics:
   * _Open Participation_: Users can anonymously or pseudonymously participate in network activities like mining, validating transactions, or using services.
   * _Decentralization_: There is no central authority controlling the network, making it resilient to censorship and central points of failure.
   * _Transparency_: Transactions are transparent and verifiable by all network participants.
3. Examples: Bitcoin and Ethereum (in its current form) are prominent examples of permissionless blockchains.
4. Use Cases: Ideal for applications where trust among participants is minimal, and a high degree of transparency and security is required, such as in public cryptocurrencies
