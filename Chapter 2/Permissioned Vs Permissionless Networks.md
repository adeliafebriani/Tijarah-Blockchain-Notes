# Permissioned Vs Permissionless Networks

![ppc](https://github.com/adeliafebriani/Tijarah-Blockchain-Notes/assets/162258265/2c5a86eb-8c7e-4c32-bfd7-be2620ce9bde)

## Permissionless Networks
1. Definition:
   * public and decentralize
   * Open and high decentralization
   * Anyone can join and participate without  permission
   * Networks epitomize the original ethos of blockchain technology, emphasizing decentralization and inclusivity.
3. Characteristics:
   * _Open Participation_: ***anonymously*** or pseudonymously participate (mining, validating transactions, or using services). It does not ask users for identification or personal information.
   * _Decentralization_: ***no central authority*** that controls, making it resilient to censorship and central points of failure.
   * _Transparency_: ***transparent and verifiable by all*** network participants.
   * _Tokens_: tokens or digital assets, either increasing in value or decreasing in value over time.
4. Examples:
   * Bitcoin & Ethereum
   * both are very decentralized, very secure, very slow, and open to anyone with a web connection
5. Use Cases:
   * trust among participants is minimal
   * high degree of transparency and security
   * suitable for trustless interactions.
   * ideal for scenarios not requiring strict control.
   * like public cryptocurrencies
   * permissionless for scenarios without centralized control needs.
6. Pros and Cons:

|Pros|Cons|
|---|---|
|***Decentralization***: Open to anyone, fostering a more decentralized system.|***Scalability Challenges***: May face issues with speed and congestion.|
|***Censorship Resistance***: Resistant to censorship, offering greater freedom.|***Energy Consumption***: Energy-intensive, raising environmental concerns.|
|***Open Innovation***: Allows diverse applications and ideas to flourish.|***Governance Difficulties***: Lack of clear governance can lead to challenges.|
|***Global Accessibility***: Provides financial services globally, including to the unbanked.||

## Permissioned Networks
1. Definition:
   * Restricted and centrally managed
   * Requires authorization from the network's governing entity or consortium
   * This structure allows for more control over the network's activities.
2. Characteristics
   * _Selective Participation_: ***Only verified and authorized entities*** can participate in network activities including transaction validation, governance, and access to certain information.
   * _Efficiency and Scalability_: With fewer nodes to manage consensus, permissioned networks can ***handle transactions more efficiently and scale more effectively*** than permissionless networks.
   * _Privacy_: greater ***privacy and transaction visibility can be restricted*** to certain participants.
3. Examples:
   * Hyperledger Fabric 
   * R3â€™s Corda
4. Use Cases:
   * enterprise
   * business applications
   * where privacy, compliance, and fast transaction processing are key
   * supply chain management or financial services.
   * emphasizes network integrity and compliance.
   * permissioned for business applications with regulatory considerations.
5. Pros and Cons:

|Pros|Cons|
|---|---|
|***Scalability and Performance***: Better transaction speeds and efficiency.|***Centralization Risk***: Increased risk of centralization with a controlled group.|
|***Privacy and Confidentiality***: Greater control over data access for participants.|***Limited Innovation***: Potential restriction on innovative developments.|
|***Regulatory Compliance***: Easier adherence to regulatory requirements.|***Dependency on Participants***: Relies on the cooperation of predetermined participants.|
|***Efficient Governance***: Streamlined decision-making processes.||

## Difference between Permissionless & Permissioned Blockchain
|Permissionless|Permissioned|
|:---:|:---:|
|Anyone can access, create data, publish smart contracts, and run a node|Closed ecosystems (only preapproved entities can run nodes)|
|100% transparency|Decentralization and transparency vary|
|High level of anonymity|No anonymity|
|Mining is required|Mining is not required to validate transactions or execute smart contracts|
|Monetary incentives to nodes (miners)|No tokens given to nodes as incentive|
|Performance is slow|Performance is drastically increased|
|Scaling is a massive challenge|Scaling is drastically increassed|
|Enjoy freedom in decentralization|Enjoy freedom in configurational flexibility|
