# Permissioned Vs Permissionless Networks

![ppc](https://github.com/adeliafebriani/Tijarah-Blockchain-Notes/assets/162258265/2c5a86eb-8c7e-4c32-bfd7-be2620ce9bde)

### Permissionless Networks
1. Definition: Open and decentralized. ***Anyone can join and participate*** in the network without  permission. These networks epitomize the original ethos of blockchain technology, emphasizing decentralization and inclusivity.
2. Characteristics:
   * _Open Participation_: anonymously or pseudonymously participate (mining, validating transactions, or using services).
   * _Decentralization_: no central authority that controls, making it resilient to censorship and central points of failure.
   * _Transparency_: transparent and verifiable by all network participants.
3. Examples: Bitcoin and Ethereum (in its current form) are prominent examples of permissionless blockchains.
4. Use Cases: Ideal for applications where trust among participants is minimal, and a high degree of transparency and security is required, such as in public cryptocurrencies

### Permissioned Networks
1. Definition: ***Restricted and centrally managed***. Participation in these networks requires authorization from the network's governing entity or consortium. This structure allows for more control over the network's activities.
2. Characteristics
   * _Selective Participation_: Only verified and authorized entities can participate in network activities including transaction validation, governance, and access to certain information.
   * _Efficiency and Scalability_: With fewer nodes to manage consensus, permissioned networks can often handle transactions more efficiently and scale more effectively than permissionless networks.
   * _Privacy_: greater privacy and transaction visibility can be restricted to certain participants.
3. Examples:
   * Hyperledger Fabric 
   * R3â€™s Corda
5. Use Cases: Suitable for enterprise and business applications where privacy, compliance, and fast transaction processing are key, such as in supply chain management or financial services.

> [!NOTE]
> #### Permissionless networks
> * offer a high degree of decentralization
> * suitable for scenarios requiring trustless interactions.
> #### Permissioned networks
> * more control and privacy (a preferable choice) for business applications where network integrity and compliance are crucial
