# Blockchain Architecture
## What is blockchain?
* A complex, innovative structure that allows for **secure, transparent, and decentralized digital transactions**.
* Key components, such as **consensus mechanisms and nodes**, play vital roles in its functionality and reliability.

### Nodes: The Foundation of Blockchain
1. Node is any computing device (computer, laptop, server).
2. Each **node holds a copy of the entire blockchain ledger**, contributing to the network's robustness and security.
3. Types of Nodes:
   * full nodes: store the entire blockchain history
   * lightweight or 'thin' nodes: store only a portion of it for efficiency
   * mining nodes: in the creation of new blocks (in Proof of Work systems).
