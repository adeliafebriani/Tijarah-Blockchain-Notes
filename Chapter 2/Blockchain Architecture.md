# Blockchain Architecture
### What is blockchain architecture?

* Blockchain architecture is a complex, innovative structure that allows for secure, transparent, and decentralized digital transactions.
* Consensus mechanisms and node's roles in its functionality and reliability.
* Data is stored, verified, and transferred.
* Its decentralized nature, coupled with robust consensus mechanisms and the distributed ledger system, provides a secure and transparent framework for various applications, from cryptocurrencies to supply chain management.

### Layering of Blockchain Architecture

### Nodes: The Foundation of Blockchain

1. Node is any computing device (computer, laptop, server).
2. Each node holds a copy of the entire blockchain ledger, contributing to the network's robustness and security.
3. Types of Nodes
   * full nodes: store the entire blockchain history
   * lightweight or 'thin' nodes: store only a portion of it for efficiency
   * mining nodes: in the creation of new blocks (in Proof of Work systems)
  
### Consensus Mechanisms: Ensuring Agreement and Security

1. Purpose: Maintain the integrity and consistency of the ledger across all nodes.
2. Types
   * Proof of Work (PoW): solving complex mathematical puzzles to validate transactions and create new blocks. It's secure but energy-intensive.
   * Proof of Stake (PoS): PoS selects validators based on their stake in the network (how many coins they hold and are willing to 'stake' as collateral), reducing energy consumption.
   * Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)
   * Proof of Authority (PoA)

### Blockchain Ledger: Immutable and Distributed
1. Ledger Characteristics:
   * immutable, once data is entered, it cannot be altered retroactively
   * safeguarded by the interlinking of blocks through cryptographic hashes.
2. Distribution:
   * distributed across all nodes in the network.
   * each node maintains an ***identical copy, ensuring transparency*** and making the system ***resistant to data loss or manipulation***.

### Smart Contract
Ethereum, smart contracts automate agreements and transactions based on predefined rules, executed without human intervention.

### Public vs. Private Blockchains
* Public == open to anyone
* * Private == restrict access (more controlled environment, preferred by enterprises)
