# Blockchain Architecture
### What is blockchain architecture?
* A complex, innovative structure that allows for ***secure, transparent, and decentralized digital transactions***.
* Key components, such as ***consensus mechanisms and nodes***, play vital roles in its functionality and reliability.
* Data is stored, verified, and transferred.
* Its decentralized nature, coupled with robust consensus mechanisms and the distributed ledger system, provides a secure and transparent framework for various applications, from cryptocurrencies to supply chain management. As technology evolves, so too will its architecture, adapting to new challenges and opportunities in the digital world.

### Nodes: The Foundation of Blockchain
1. Node is any computing device (computer, laptop, server).
2. Each ***node holds a copy of the entire blockchain ledger***, contributing to the network's robustness and security.
3. Types of Nodes:
   * full nodes: store the entire blockchain history
   * lightweight or 'thin' nodes: store only a portion of it for efficiency
   * mining nodes: in the creation of new blocks (in Proof of Work systems)
  
### Consensus Mechanisms: Ensuring Agreement and Security
1. Purpose: The consensus mechanism is a core component, responsible for ***maintaining the integrity and consistency of the ledger*** across all nodes.
2. Types:
   * Proof of Work (PoW): solving complex mathematical puzzles to validate transactions and create new blocks. It's secure but energy-intensive.
   * Proof of Stake (PoS): An alternative to PoW, PoS selects validators based on their stake in the network (how many coins they hold and are willing to 'stake' as collateral), reducing energy consumption.
   * Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)
   * Proof of Authority (PoA)
   * each with unique features aiming at efficiency, speed, and security

### Blockchain Ledger: Immutable and Distributed
1. Ledger Characteristics: ***immutable***, meaning once data is entered, it cannot be altered retroactively. This immutability is safeguarded by the interlinking of blocks through cryptographic hashes.
2. Distribution: distributed across all nodes in the network. Each node maintains an ***identical copy, ensuring transparency*** and making the system ***resistant to data loss or manipulation***.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ### Smart Contract
> Ethereum, smart contracts automate agreements and transactions based on predefined rules, executed without human intervention.
> ### Public vs. Private Blockchains
> * Public == open to anyone
> * Private == restrict access (more controlled environment, preferred by enterprises)
