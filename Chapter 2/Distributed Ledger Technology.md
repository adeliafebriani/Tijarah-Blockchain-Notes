# Distributed Ledger Technology

### What is Distributed Ledger Technology?
Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) is a digital system for recording the transaction of assets in which the transactions and their details are recorded in multiple places at the same time. Unlike traditional databases, DLT has no central data store or administration functionality. In a DLT, every node in the network processes every transaction, coming to its conclusions and then voting on those conclusions to make sure the majority agree with the conclusions. This process is known as consensus, and it allows for the recording of transactions in a decentralized and secure manner.
