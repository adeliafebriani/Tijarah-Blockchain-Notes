# Consensus Mechanisms in Blockchain
![Consensus Mechanism](https://github.com/adeliafebriani/Tijarah-Blockchain-Notes/assets/162258265/f5f2f495-ca79-4d86-a45d-9b738c3deb42)

Consensus Mechanisms are the protocols that 
- ensure all nodes in a blockchain network agree on the validity of transactions
- maintaining the integrity and trust in the distributed ledger

Without it,
- lack of synchronization and agreement among nodes
- leading to potential conflicts
- security issues

### Why Are Consensus Mechanisms Necessary?

1. **Decentralization**: CM enables network participants to agree on the current state of the ledger. 

2. **Security**: Protect the blockchain from fraudulent transactions and malicious actors. By requiring agreement from multiple nodes, it's hard to make any single entity manipulate the ledger.

3. **Integrity and Trust**: CM ensures that once a transaction is confirmed, it can be trusted as valid. This builds confidence among users in the system's reliability.

4. **Network Synchronization**: Ensuring every participant has the same, up-to-date version of the ledger.

## Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT)

BFT is a system property that can resist the cause of failure from Byzantine problems.
> [!NOTE]
> BFT will continue operating even when some of the node fails to communicate

## Istanbul Byzantine Fault Tolerance (IBFT)
![IBFT](https://github.com/adeliafebriani/Tijarah-Blockchain-Notes/assets/162258265/e0a34003-832d-4dde-a0f5-13a97125414a)

IBFT adapts the Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) mechanism designed to work in Ethereum-based blockchain systems.

#### How it works?

* **Validator Nodes**: A group of validator nodes is pre-determined. They are responsible for managing the consensus process.

* **Block Validation Process**: Block created, and propagated to the validator nodes. For the block to be validated and added to the blockchain, a supermajority (typically more than two-thirds) of the validator must agree on its validity.

* **Fault Tolerance**: IBFT can tolerate up to 1/3 of the validator nodes acting maliciously or going offline without affecting the network's integrity and performance.

* **Finality**: Once a block is confirmed, it cannot be changed or reversed, eliminating the possibility of forks.

#### Advantages
* provides quick and final consensus with high fault tolerance.
* suitable for permissioned or consortium blockchains where validators are known and trusted entities.

## Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT)
PBFT was introduced to address the limitations of the traditional Byzantine Fault Tolerance in practical, real-world applications.

#### How it Works?

* **Three-Phase Protocol**: PBFT operates in three phases - pre-prepare, prepare, and commit. This ensures that all nodes in the network agree on the new block's content.

* **Leader Selection**: One node is elected as the leader (primary), which proposes the block. Other nodes (replicas) validate and agree on the proposed block.

* **Fault Tolerance**: Like IBFT, PBFT can handle up to 1/3 of faulty nodes in the network.

#### Advantages
* efficient and offers a low-latency consensus mechanism without intensive computational requirements
* ideal for networks where participants are partially trusted
* a high transaction throughput is necessary

#### Use Cases
PBFT is commonly used in private or consortium blockchain networks, particularly where quick consensus and transaction finality are important.
