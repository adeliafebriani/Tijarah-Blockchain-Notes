# Differences PoW, PoS, DPoS, and PoET

Trade-Off|	POW	|POS|	DPoS|	POET|	POA
---|---|---|---|---|---
Decentralization|Decentralized, but mining power tends to centralize|Varies depending on implementation, generally more decentralized than POW|Semi-decentralized depends on the number of elected delegates|Decentralization depends on the governance model of the permissioned network	|Less decentralized as authority nodes are predetermined
Scalability|Limited scalability due to energy-intensive mining process|Potential for improved scalability through various implementations|Scalability depends on the number of elected delegates and network architecture|Scalability depends on network architecture and implementation|	Can achieve high scalability due to the controlled nature of the network
Energy Efficiency|Less energy-efficient due to computational competition|More energy-efficient compared to POW	More energy-efficient compared to POW, but less than some POS implementations	|Energy-efficient as it doesn't require intense computational work|Highly energy-efficient as it doesn't require mining
Security|Generally high security due to massive computational power|Security depends on the distribution of stake among validators|Security depends on the honesty of elected delegates	|Security relies on the randomness and fairness of the time selection process|Security relies on the trustworthiness of authority nodes
Suitability|Suitable for public blockchains, particularly in early-stage networks where decentralization is prioritized|Suitable for public blockchains aiming to improve energy efficiency and scalability|Suitable for public blockchains that require faster transaction speeds|Suitable for permissioned blockchains requiring fairness and randomness in block proposal|Suitable for permissioned networks where efficiency and controlled governance are prioritized
