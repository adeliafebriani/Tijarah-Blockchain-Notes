# Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)

2014- Daniel Larimer.
Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) is a consensus algorithm that addresses the challenges of scalability and energy efficiency faced by traditional blockchain networks like Bitcoin. It's responsible for validating new blocks, which may be more effective than its predecessor: PoS. Both PoS and DPoS are alternatives to PoW.

### How does it work?

* Design as the implementation of digital democracy.
* Fixed number of delegates between 21 and 101.

* It is chosen by the vote of the network participants (who own coins and staked) as witnesses.
* It is validated and rewarded for adding blocks to the blockchain.

* Each stakeholder gets the number of votes, proportional to the quantity of coins he has, or they can choose to delegate the value of their stake in favour of another participant in the network, who will then vote on their behalf.

* Delegates take turns in bulk production, usually every few seconds.
* Delegates who misbehave or fail constantly in bulk production, will lose their reputation and quickly be rejected and replaced by new delegates.
* Certain systems may require delegates to deposit a certain amount of funds, as proof of their participation (stake) which demonstrates their commitment.
* These funds will be left in reserve and will be confiscated if the delegates act maliciously.

* The general rule is that the longest chain always wins, they will move from the previously valid "current fork" (bifurcation) to the longest chain.

### Delegated Proof of Stack vs Proof of Work

Compared to the proof of work (Pow) algorithm, DPoS offers better performance, and a more efficient solution from the point of view of energy consumption, eliminating intense competition between miners, since ASICS are no longer necessary to solve complex mathematical problems.

This solution also promotes decentralization, because anyone can become a delegate, and it is no longer necessary to have large mining pools to validate blocks.

However, an excessive degree of decentralization
must not be achieved, because otherwise
with an excessive number of delegates, you run the risk of losing speed.

Using Delegated Proof of Stake as consensus algorithm develops in the field of cryptocurrencies. But because the industry evolves very quickly, new algorithms will undoubtedly emerge, always with the aim of continue to improve the current system.
