# Introduction to smart contracts

### Key Concepts

1. Code-based Contracts: Unlike traditional contracts, which are written in natural language and enforced by legal systems, **smart contracts are written in code**. This code defines the rules and conditions of the agreement.
2. Decentralized Execution: Smart contracts run on blockchain networks, which are decentralized and distributed ledgers. This means that once deployed, the code is executed across multiple nodes on the network, ensuring transparency and immutability.
3. Automation: One of the key benefits of smart contracts is automation. Once deployed on the blockchain, they automatically execute when predefined conditions are met. This automation eliminates the need for intermediaries and reduces the potential for human error or manipulation.
4. Transparency and Immutability: Because smart contracts are executed on a blockchain, all transactions and contract states are transparent and immutable. Once a smart contract is deployed, its code and execution cannot be altered, providing a high level of security and trust.
5. Use Cases: Smart contracts have a wide range of potential applications, including financial services (e.g., automated payments, lending, and trading), supply chain management (e.g., tracking the provenance of goods), digital identity management, voting systems, and more.
6. Programming Languages: Smart contracts can be written in various programming languages, depending on the blockchain platform. For example, Ethereum primarily uses Solidity, while other platforms like EOS support languages like C++ and Python.
7. Gas Fees: Deploying and executing smart contracts typically incur fees known as "gas" on Ethereum and similar networks. Gas fees are paid in cryptocurrency and compensate the network for the computational resources required to execute the contract.
