# Blockchain
## Cryptocurrency
### Benefits of cryptocurrency
* cryptocurrencies are immune to counterfeiting
* don't require a central authority
* protected by strong and complex encryption algorithms

### Hacker cannot alter the data because:
* each user has a copy of the ledger
* complex algorithms encrypt data within blocks

### Keys
* Public key- everyone will know
* Private key- only the user will know

### Tools
* Bitcoin- SHA256
* Etherea- Ethash

### Why do we need Blockchain?
* double spending
* net frauds (gain unauthorized access to steal your money)
* high transaction fee
* poor data recovery (lost data)

### Bitcoin
* digital currency
* not include third-party
* fast cheap transfer
* personal info hidden
* cryptographically secured

### Blockchain Structure (database of immutable records)
1. Header
   * number of blocks
   * hash (previous)
   * timestamp
   * nonce (random number)
   * hash (alpha value to identify block)
2. Transaction details
   * sender
   * receiver
   * amount

### Blockchain Features
* SHA256 encryption
* public and private key (cryptographic key)
* distributed public ledger
* mining: miners who validate the hash and get a reward
* proof of work (POW): mining -> determine nonce -> hash value -> if less than target value

### Application of Blockchain
* voting (transparency)
* supply chain (defect detected)
* insurance (prevent false claims)
* accounting (maintain accurate info, protect data)

### Security
* fingerprint (the right user)
* private key (only for the user)
